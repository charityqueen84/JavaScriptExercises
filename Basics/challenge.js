let firstName = 'Charity';
let lastName = 'Queen';

////or could do a fullName variable after this and put the space in there. 

let firstName1 = 'John';
let lastName2 = 'Smith';
let fullName = firstName1 + ' ' + lastName2;

console.log('Congratulations ' + fullName + '. You have solved your first JavaScript challenge');
